## üöß Installation

### Usage with VS Code

For quick installation, use one of the one-click install buttons at the top of this README.

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

To configure the MCP server for Gitea, add the following to your MCP configuration file:

- **stdio mode**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitea": {
      "command": "gitea-mcp",
      "args": [
        "-t",
        "stdio",
        "--host",
        "https://gitea.com"
        // "--token", "<your personal access token>"
      ],
      "env": {
        // "GITEA_HOST": "https://gitea.com",
        "GITEA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<your personal access token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **sse mode**

```json
{

    }
  }
}
```
